##### Docker images verifier cli-tool (CVE-2018-8115)
To help the community stay safe, we at Aqua created an open source tool
that tests images for whether they are safe of this vulnerability.

This uitlity will connect to the Docker Registry (currently only Docker Hub supported) and check whether an image has a malicous file that can exploit the CVE-2018-8115 vulnerability, known to attack the host as part of a "docker pull" command.

## Usage

python verify.py <image name>
